right now CART does all  its stuff with its own code.. . 


but CART instead should just reuse  TCM..

              see   /home/victor/cart/calling_tcm_from_another_script.py  

for an example of how to do this.

This way we could get those warning messages from TCM  piped through to CART.


		-- not a big deal for now though since you'll get the messages when using TCM.

just something to think about.
