VCCK right now just has a variable, 'DEBUGGING' at top of script that is manually changed in the code itself from
  True to False or vice versa,


This should be set via a variable..... (yes, this is a feature of VCCK not CART),  but then once that feature is

added, then CART should run ALL TESTS on VCCK,  

	-- once with DEBUGGING = True

	-- then a second time, ALL TESTS, but this time wiht DEBUGGING = False

--

pass only if  *BOTH*   Debugging ON and OFF !
