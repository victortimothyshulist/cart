-- Then, a given FSDB, v1.000.conf  CART_INCLUDE file shoud do a ( IF  LINE NUMBER == 1, "un-tar the sr_list.inf file and alt_text")
		 
/1/ cart    if exists  sr list info, delete before installing next fsdb
        delete sr_list.inf
         same for alt text directory
         same for constant_strings.dat
        same for groups

/2/ cart include  v1.000-move.py     that checks if fsdb is xxxxx  and line input is 1  do a tar zxf which installs    1) alt  text dir  2) sr_list.inf ,  3) groups  

			*THE ONLY THING that should **NOT** *be in an FSDB is  "constant_strings.dat" -->> cuz that is the result of a previous compile.

/3/   start dev-ing in real file/dir ... make new module

/4/ start new cart fsdb   ...  for existing fast str scan code

/5/ check on changed load group code    spaces to underscore????

/6/ file manifest with md/sha256 ..  if cart test pass   then asks "Do you want to update file manifest??"
         only when run conalaun from NOT under cart...  calculates all md5 of files and compares with manifest ... fails to start if any md5 differs

------- if md5 of ico compiler differs ....  gives warning  to manually retest validation logic   syntax check of ico files... and create cart test cases.
