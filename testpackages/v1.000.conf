# CART test packages for CONALAUN version 1.000

## for Future functionality, where we validate that an "RR" cannot just exist in an "I" line or just exist in "C1" line...
## we have CART FSDB's already that validate this.
## we will have a "FLAG" set to True after every loop through main loop (main loop that reads in LUI, and parses ICO file), and 
## that flag will, by default, be set to do that validation
## but for FSDB's that violate that, we'll have a CART_INCLUDE line that will say "If VERSION=1.000 *and* current File state DB is <X>, then
## disable that FLAG.  (until next loop). That will allow us to test with FSDB's that otherwise would be rejected by CONALAUN.
